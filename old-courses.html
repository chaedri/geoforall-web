                MEA592: Multidimensional Geospatial Modeling</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The course covers concepts, methods and tools for analysis and modeling of landscape
            dynamics using multitemporal georeferenced data and simulations. Representation of evolving
            phenomena using point clouds and particles, surfaces and voxel models will be explained.
            The course will also include hands-on practice and development of techniques for visualization
            and communication of lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations using the state of the art
            technology in the GIST Visualization laboratory, such as 3D projection,
            immersion and tangible modeling system.

                GIS/MEA792: Advanced Geospatial Modeling</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The course provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in GIS modeling.
            Special focus is on integrated modeling using vector and raster data processing,
            data base management tools, basic image processing, and python programing for open source GIS.
            The course includes workflow development combining different tools from open source geospatial
            software stack especially GRASS GIS, GDAL/OGR, libLAS and others. Applications / case studies
            will include terrain modeling, geomorphometry, coastal evolution, volume modeling,
            dynamic visualization,
            and GIS-based modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).

            </h4>
        <p>
            This course examines the spatial database models and structures used in geospatial
            information science and technology as well as the design and implementation of web
            and related mobile computing geospatial tools and systems. Students develop, evaluate,
            and deploy multiple spatial data models and web services that include connections
            to external data sources and systems.
