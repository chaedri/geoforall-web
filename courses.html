      <h5><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea582/common/GIST.html">GIS/MEA582: Geospatial Analysis and Modeling</a></h5>
      <p>The course explains digital representation and analysis of geospatial phenomena
         and provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in GIS analysis.
         Special focus is on terrain modeling, geomorphometry, watershed analysis
         and introductory GIS-based modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).
         The course includes analysis from lidar data, 3D visualization, and exploratory
         land management design with Tangible GIS. Assignments are performed in Open source GRASS GIS and ArcGIS.</p>

      <h5><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea792/common/GIST_MEA792.html">GIS/MEA792: Advanced Geospatial Modeling</a></h5>
      <p>The course provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in GIS modeling. Special focus is on integrated modeling using vector and raster data processing, data base management tools, basic image processing, and python programing for open source GIS. The course includes workflow development combining different tools from open source geospatial software stack especially GRASS GIS, GDAL/OGR, libLAS and others. Applications / case studies will include terrain modeling, geomorphometry, coastal evolution, volume modeling, dynamic visualization, and GIS-based modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).</p>
