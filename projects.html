      <h4><a href="https://popsmodel.org">Pest or Pathogen Spread Model (PoPS)</a></h4>
      <p>PoPS (the Pest or Pathogen Spread Model) is a framework for modeling
          the spread of pests or pathogens across a landscape.
          PoPS can help decision-makers, researchers, and students create geospatial distribution models.
          PoPS can is distributed as R package and GRASS GIS module.

      <p>FUTURES, FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation,
          is an open source urban growth model specifically designed 
          to address the regional-scale ecological and environmental impacts
          of urbanization and is one of the few land change models developed
          to explicitly capture the spatial structure of development. 
          FUTURES is being developed and distributed as GRASS GIS addon.

      <h4><a href="https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/research/tomorrownow/">TomorrowNow</a></h4>
      <p>TomorrowNow is a collaborative project led by four universities in
          North Carolina focused on developing a serious game that can help
          a greater number, and a greater diversity, of people affect decisions
          that impact the places where they live and work. We are using real
          spatial data and developing interactive technologies that can help
          build common understanding of challenges in the Triangle, and figure
          out how to address them.

      <p>The North Carolina Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Testing (PFAST)
          Network is a statewide research collaboration to test for current
           levels of PFAS chemicals in drinking water and air samples across the state.
           Our team provides geospatial data expertise and tools to support PFAST
            data-related activities and support PFAST Network data science requirements.

     Tangible Landscape <span style="font-size: 85%;">(formerly TanGeoMS)</span></a></h4>
     <p>
          Tangible Landscape (formerly known as TanGeoMS) is a collaborative modeling environment for analysis of terrain changes.
          We couple a scanner, projector and a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS.
          We can analyze the impact of terrain changes by capturing the changes on the model,
          bringing them into the GIS, performing desired analysis or simulation and projecting the results back on the model.
          We develop Tangible Landscape as a collection
          of free and open source software where GRASS GIS plays a major role as an analytical tool.

     <h4><a href="./multidim-geovis.html">Multidimensional geovisualization in GRASS GIS</a></h4>
     <p>We are developing geovisualization methods to analyze landscape evolution through time and space.
        We apply space-time cube approach to visualize evolving elevation contours as isosurfaces
        with additional attribute expressed by color. Additionally, we animate dynamic processes including water flow,
        sediment transport and fire spread, and project them on physical models in our TanGeoMS environment.
        As for our study sites, we focus on rapidly changing landscapes, such as the Jockey's Ridge on the Outer Banks, NC.
        We extensively use GRASS GIS both for modeling and for analytical 3D visualizations and animations.</p>

     GIS-based soil erosion/deposition modeling</a></h4>
     <p>We develop GIS-based tools and applications for modeling erosion and deposition patterns in complex landscapes.
        We use the models to map areas with high erosion and deposition potential providing information
        for sustainable land use management. We also provide support for erosion modeling used in simulations
        of coupled human-natural systems.</p>

     Terrain dynamics analysis using voxel models and lidar data time series</a></h4>
     <p>We develop visualization and analytics tools to provide insight into short term evolution
        of landscapes with rapidly changing topography. We use space-time cube concept
        to visualize elevation contour evolution as isosurfaces and investigate spatial
        patterns of space-time gradients.</p>

     Coastal dynamics and sustainability</a></h4>
     <p>We analyze and visualize barrier island terrain dynamics using time series of lidar data.
        We have developed set of metrics that quantifies short term sand redistribution, shoreline
        evolution and sand dune migration. Our GIS-based methods provide tools for mapping
        barrier island vulnerability to storm surge and to extract important terrain features
        used as inputs for coastal process simulations.</p>
