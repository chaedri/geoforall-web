     TanGeoMS: Tangible geospatial modeling system</a></h4>
     <p>TanGeoMS is a collaborative modeling environment for analysis of terrain changes.
        We couple a scanner, projector and a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS.
        We can analyse the impact of terrain changes by capturing the changes on the model,
        bringing them into the GIS, performing desired analysis or simulation and projecting the results back on the model.</p>

     GRASS GIS Graphical User Interface</a></h4>
     <p>We are actively contributing to the GRASS GIS GUI by adding and improving
        visualization tools and maintaining the present code. We get feedback from students
        using the software during the classes as well as from GRASS GIS user community.</p>
     <p>GRASS GIS GUI development include Python programming with wxPython graphical toolkit.</p>
