                GIS/MEA582: Geospatial Analysis and Modeling</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The course explains digital representation and analysis of
            geospatial phenomena and provides foundations in methods and algorithms
            used in GIS analysis. Special focus is on terrain modeling, geomorphometry,
            watershed analysis and introductory GIS-based modeling of
            landscape processes (water, sediment).
            The course includes analysis from lidar data, coastal change assessment and 3D visualization.
            All assignments are done in two software packages &ndash; GRASS GIS and ArcGIS &ndash;
            to untangle general geospatial analytical concepts from software specifics.
            The <a href="http://ncsu-osgeorel.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/grass">GRASS GIS part</a>
            is very popular even outside NCSU.

        </h4>
        <p>
            The course covers monitoring, analysis, and modeling of 3D
            landscape change using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and lidar data.
            The principles of UAS data collection, processing of 3D point clouds
            and the resulting terrain models are explained followed by hands-on
            experience with multitemporal data collected by
            the NCSU NextGen Air Transportation (NGAT) program.
            The course also covers techniques for analysis and visualization
            of lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations,
            including immersive visualization at the Hunt library facilities.
            The students will have the opportunity to work with the Tangible Landscape system
            to explore impact of 3D terrain change on landscape parameters and processes.

        </h4>
        <p>
            This course will focus on how GIS can be an integral part of the creative design process.
            You will be taught terrain, hydrological, and overlay modeling
            and analysis in two and three dimensions.
            You will also learn how to generate and develop the seed
            of a design in GIS as part of an iterative design process.
            With visual programming students will learn how conceptual
            and logical models can structure and generate designs,
            linking creative abstraction, computational exploration,
            structured decision-making, and expression.
            As part of an iterative design process students will learn
            workflows linking 3D GIS, 3D modeling, and rapid prototyping
            (3D printing, CNC fabrication, and laser cutting).

        <p>
            First, we will introduce you to GRASS GIS 7, including its spatio-temporal
            capabilities and you will learn how to manage and analyze geospatial data time series.
            Then, we will explore new tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data.
            You will create both 2D and 3D dynamic visualizations directly in GRASS GIS 7.
            Additionally, we will explain the Space Time Cube concept using various
            applications based on raster and vector data time series.
            You will learn to manage and visualize data in space time cubes (voxel models).
            No prior knowledge of GRASS GIS is necessary,
            we will cover the basics needed for the workshop.
