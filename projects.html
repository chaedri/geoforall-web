     TanGeoMS: Tangible geospatial modeling system</a></h4>
     <p>TanGeoMS is a collaborative modeling environment for analysis of terrain changes.
        We couple a scanner, projector and a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS.
        We can analyze the impact of terrain changes by capturing the changes on the model,
        bringing them into the GIS, performing desired analysis or simulation and projecting the results back on the model.</p>

     <h4><a href="./multidim-geovis.html">Multidimensional geovisualization in GRASS GIS</a></h4>
     <p>We are developing geovisualization methods to analyze landscape evolution through time and space.
        We apply space-time cube approach to visualize evolving elevation contours as isosurfaces
        with additional attribute expressed by color. Additionally, we animate dynamic processes including water flow,
        sediment transport and fire spread, and project them on physical models in our TanGeoMS environment.
        As for our study sites, we focus on rapidly changing landscapes, such as the Jockey's Ridge on the Outer Banks, NC.
        We extensively use GRASS GIS both for modeling and for analytical 3D visualizations and animations.</p>

     <h4><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~helena/erhome.html">
     GIS-based soil erosion/deposition modeling</a></h4>
     <p>We develop GIS-based tools and applications for modeling erosion and deposition patterns in complex landscapes.
        We use the models to map areas with high erosion and deposition potential providing information
        for sustainable land use management. We also provide support for erosion modeling used in simulations
        of coupled human-natural systems.</p>

     <!--umstead bank erosion and Emily's work and geosphere paper material cover this topic-->
     Terrain dynamics analysis using voxel models and lidar data time series</a></h4>
     <p>We develop visualization and analytics tools to provide insight into short term evolution
        of landscapes with rapidly changing topography. We use space-time cube concept
        to visualize elevation contour evolution as isosurfaces and investigate spatial
        patterns of space-time gradients.</p>

     <h4><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~helena/coast.html">
     Coastal dynamics and sustainability</a></h4>
     <p>We analyze and visualize barrier island terrain dynamics using time series of lidar data.
        We have developed set of metrics that quantifies short term sand redistribution, shoreline
        evolution and sand dune migration. Our GIS-based methods provide tools for mapping
        barrier island vulnerability to storm surge and to extract important terrain features
        used as inputs for coastal process simulations.</p>

     <h4><a href="grass-gis-gui.html">
     GRASS GIS Graphical User Interface</a></h4>
     <p>We are actively contributing to the GRASS GIS GUI by adding and improving
        visualization tools and maintaining the present code. We get feedback from students
        using the software during the classes as well as from GRASS GIS user community.</p>
     <p>GRASS GIS GUI development includes Python programming with wxPython graphical toolkit.</p>

     GIS-based fire spread modeling</a></h4>
     <p>We use GRASS GIS wildfire toolbox to simulate fire spread
        based on terrain, available fuel and wind.</p>
