     TanGeoMS: Tangible geospatial modeling system</a></h4>
     <p>TanGeoMS is a collaborative modeling environment for analysis of terrain changes.
        We couple a scanner, projector and a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS.
        We can analyze the impact of terrain changes by capturing the changes on the model,
        bringing them into the GIS, performing desired analysis or simulation and projecting the results back on the model.</p>

     <h4>Multidimensional geovisualization in GRASS GIS</h4>
     <p>We are developing geovisualization methods to analyze landscape evolution through time and space.
        We apply space-time cube approach to visualize evolving elevation contours as isosurfaces
        with additional attribute expressed by color. Additionally, we animate dynamic processes including water flow,
        sediment transport and fire spread, and project them on physical models in our TanGeoMS environment.
        As for our study sites, we focus on rapidly changing landscapes, such as the Jockey's Ridge on the Outer Banks, NC.
        We extensively use GRASS GIS both for modeling and for analytical 3D visualizations and animations.</p>

     <h4><a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/screenshots/user-interface/">
     GRASS GIS Graphical User Interface</a></h4>
     <p>We are actively contributing to the GRASS GIS GUI by adding and improving
        visualization tools and maintaining the present code. We get feedback from students
        using the software during the classes as well as from GRASS GIS user community.</p>
     <p>GRASS GIS GUI development includes Python programming with wxPython graphical toolkit.</p>

     <h4>GIS-based fire spread modeling</h4>
     <p>We use GRASS GIS wildfire toolbox to simulate fire spread
        based on terrain, available fuel and wind.</p>
