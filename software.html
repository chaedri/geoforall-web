      <p><a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS</a>
         is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS)
         used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing,
         spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is all purpose GIS although it is focused mainly
         on scientific GIS applications involving big data.
         GRASS GIS is the Open Source Geospatial Foundation
         (<a href="http://osgeo.org">OSGeo</a>) project.</p>
      <p>We contribute to the GRASS GIS project by developing new features
         and as a part of GRASS GIS community we support faculty and students using GRASS.
         The NCSU OSGeoREL leader, Dr. Helena Mitasova, is the co-author of the book
         <a href="http://www.grassbook.org/">Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach</a>.</p>
