<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
GRASS GIS, a free and open source geographic information system, provides
the functionality to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial data. Recently, a
temporal dimension has been integrated into GRASS GIS as a response to an in-
creasing accessibility and importance of spatio-temporal data. However, to fully
benefit from such data new capabilities for exploratory visualizations are needed.
We present a set of tools for spatio-temporal data visualization which reflects data
complexity and also supports online sharing. The GRASS GIS Animation Tool is
a desktop application working directly with different types of spatio-temporal data
stored in GRASS GIS. We can display synchronized animations of raster, vector
and 3D raster data in two- and three-dimensional views. To share spatio-temporal
visualizations online, we have developed web map applications which enable users
to explore the data as animations or derive supporting information such as his-
tograms. Our solution does not require any server-site application and enables a
file-based offline sharing and an easy online publication without any special re-
quirements on usersâ€™ software or servers. We demonstrate the desktop and online
tools on several use cases, namely solar radiation and fire spread modeling, soil
moisture analysis, and cumulative cost surface visualization.
