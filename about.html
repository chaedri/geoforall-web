<h2>About NCSU GeoForAll Lab</h2>

<p>
The NCSU GeoForAll Lab
is located at the <a href="http://geospatial.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University, Center for Geospatial Analytics</a>
in Raleigh, NC, USA.
We are part of the worldwide network of laboratories
following the motto <a href="http://geoforall.org/">Geo for All</a>
focusing on both research and education.
As one of the founding laboratories we are the central node for North America.
A list of all the labs is available at the
<a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Edu_current_initiatives">OSGeo wiki</a>.

<p>
The NCSU GeoForAll Lab was originally named
the NCSU OSGeo Research and Education Laboratory (NCSU OSGeoREL)
since OSGeo Foundation's research and education laboratories were the
original idea behind the network. However, the current name,
NCSU GeoForAll Lab, better reflects the laboratory being part of
the global and inter-organizational initiative GeoForAll.

<p>
Our mission is to develop collaboration opportunities
for academic, industrial, and government organizations in free and open source GIS software and data.


<h3>Memorandums of Understanding</h3>

<p>The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and the International Cartographic Association (ICA)
have signed a <a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/MOU_ICA">Memorandum of Understanding</a>
for developing global open source GIS software and data collaborations for academic, industrial,
and government organizations. The MoU aims to provide expertise and support
for the establishment of Open Source Geospatial Laboratories and Research Centres across the world
for development of open-source geospatial software technologies and training.
Laboratories are being established in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas and Australasia
which will act as nodes for future expansion of the <a href="http://www.geoforall.org/">worldwide network</a>.</p>

<p>As of 14th July 2014, the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)
has joined ICA and OSGeo in Geo for All initiative.</p>

<p>On 24th May 2016, the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS)
has also signed memorandum of understanding with OSGeo to join the Geo for All initiative.</p>
